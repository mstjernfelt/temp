NordVPN Add-on
==============

This add-on is a service for Kodi that allows the user to vary the level of
privacy required by automatically switching between different NordVPN
profiles/locations.

It can connect to NordVPN on Kodi startup (on OS boot for LibreELEC installs) and
then maintain the VPN connection based on the add-ons being used. The perceived
location of the externally visable IP address is displayed upon connection.

Control of the VPN is also possible via a remote control button or hot key,
allowing the user to manually cycle between connections.

Full instructions can be found on the NordVPN website
